Big Mart sales prediction
This solution is for the Big Mart sales datase, first the dataset is cleaned as it has a lot of null values, which are replaced by the mean of all the values of that column or replaced by the value mapped to it's ID. Then the rest of the dataset was converted to integer values, for example, (small-1, medium-2, large-3) etc. A couple extra columns were added deriving the relation between outlet type and locaion type, and between item visibility and store size. Then the dataset was split into test and train dataset and trained using RandomForrest Regressor, as it's score was quite low, we needed further processing. So, we calculated loss as the difference between the values predicted by the random forest regressor and the actual values, and added  it as a column to the dataset. The dataset was the re-trained using RandomForest Regressor which gave much better results.
